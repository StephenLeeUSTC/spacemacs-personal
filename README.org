* My personal Emacs configuration
  Fork from zilongshanren and migirate from vim.

  It was written for Emacs 25.1+ on MacOS 10.11+

** How to use
   This is a spacemacs personal configuration copied from zilongshanren, to use it:
   First follow the rules of spacemacs and install the develop branch

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/.emacs.d/ -b develop
   #+END_SRC

   Then clone this project
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   git clone https://github.com/StephenLeeUSTC/spacemacs-personal.git ~/.spacemacs.d/
   #+END_SRC

   At last, open emacs, and wait for some minutes

** What's the highlight of this configuration
   1. It's a highly optimized Spacemacs configuration, you should use the configuration together with the *develop* branch of the officially Spacemacs.
   2. I prefer to the =Ivy= completion interface, so I removed many helm related packages but keep the =helm-ag= package. The =counsel-ag= counterpart is not powerful as =helm-ag=.
   3. I also removed some packages I don't have any chance to use. The complete list lies in the exclude section of the =init.el= file.
   4. I also exclude the =Spaceline= package, cause it's easy to frozen the Emacs with this package enabled. So I create my own mode line configuration based on =Spaceline=.
   5. The =Swiper= package sometimes frozen the Emacs UI when you split the window with very long lines. You could use `pkill -SIGUSR2 -i emacs` command line to break the frozen.

** Happing Hacking
   Thanks to spacemacs community, syl20bnr and zilongshanren, they bring me to the wonderful world of emacs! Awesome!
